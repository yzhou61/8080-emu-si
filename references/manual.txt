Zero:
If the result of an instruction has the
value 0, this flag is set: otherwise it is
resat.
Sign:
If the most significant bit of the result of
the operation has the value 1, this flag is
set; otherwise it is reset.
Parity:
If the modulo 2 sum of the bits of the re路
suit of the operation is 0, (Le., if the
result has even parity) this flag is set,
otherwise it is reset (Le., if the result has
odd parity).
Carry:
If the instruction resulted in a carry
(from addition), or a borrow (from subtraction
or a comparison) out of the high路
order bit, this flag is set; otherwise it is
reset,
Auxiliary Carry:
If the instruction caused a carry out
of bit 3 and into bit 4 of the resulting
value, the auxiliary carry i,; set; otherwise
it is reset. This flag is affected by single
preciSIon additions, subtractions, incre路
menu. decrements, comparisons, and log路
ical operations, but i,; principally used
with addition,; and increment,; preceding
a DAA (Decimal Adjust Accumulator)
instruction.
